#gRPC

Code examples and tutorial are prepared in the Python language. However, you can easily implement tasks in the language that you prefer. In that case, you will have to configure the environment yourself.

install python if you don't already have it:

https://www.python.org/downloads/

then get gRPC with pip:

python -m pip install --upgrade pip
python -m pip install grpcio
python -m pip install grpcio-tools
